Welcome!

My name is Kevin Eaton, and I am a proud geek, father, husband, software engineering leader, and Army Chaplain. I am a Chief Software Architect in my current position with over 17 years of professional experience, specializing in NodeJS, GoLang, Elixir, Javascript, Python, and mobile development. I have tons of DevOps and architecture experience. I love designing strong, reliable, and high quality software. Software craftsmanship is a passion.

I am also an ordained minister, serving the U.S. Army as a Brigade Chaplain.

My favorite hobbies include [Taekwondo](https://www.kiantkd.com) gaming, programming, and running.
