My name is Kevin Eaton, and I am a proud geek, father, husband, software engineering leader, and Army Chaplain. I am a Chief Software Architect in my current position with over 17 years of professional experience, specializing in GoLang, NodeJS, Typescript / Javascript, PHP, Elixir, Python, and mobile development. I have tons of DevOps and architecture experience. I love designing strong, reliable, and high quality software. Software craftsmanship is a passion.
