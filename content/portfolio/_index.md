I have a wide breadth of experience in several different career fields. I am an accomplished technologist, with over two decades of experience in programming, systems administration, DevOps, and engineering leadership. My primary programming languages and stacks right now are Go, Svelte, React, Typescript / Javascript, and Python. For data and messaging, I prefer MySQL, RabbitMQ, and Redis. I use Ansible and Docker extensively.
