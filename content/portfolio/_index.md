I have a wide breadth of experience in several different career fields. I am an accomplished technologist, with nearly two decades of experience in programming, systems administration, DevOps, and engineering leadership.

I also have over 16 years of military experience and server as a Brigade Chaplain (Major) in the US Army Reserve.
