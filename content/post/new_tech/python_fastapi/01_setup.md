In this post, we will cover getting set up with Python 3 on an Ubuntu machine and making sure we are good to get started.

## Reminder

This is a documentation of my attempt to learn Python with FastAPI to build a simple API. I prefer to learn new tech by doing. This is akin to journaling and is not intended to be used in a production environment. It is a learning experiment. For more information see:

## Getting Started
