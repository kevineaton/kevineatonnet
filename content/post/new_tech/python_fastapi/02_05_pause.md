## A Pause

Many of you may have noticed a lack of progress. The time from collapse to new chapters was chaotic good. The end result is that since 6/1/2023, my time was full of non-coding, non-learning opportunities, so I paused on Python3. I debated unpublishing the posts to avoid the risk of some poor soul finding them and thinking that's how production code should look, but I think I made it clear what the status was. At some point in the future, I will come back to this, or I will unpublish and remove from the site to be reborn in the future.

Honestly, I thought I would hve a lot more time, which is why I undertook the endeavor in the first place. I thought that surely I would end up somewhere that would want some Python experience to supplement my other skills. The reality is, I am super excited about my new position as a Product Software Architect at a major pet tech company that has never had that role before. I'm going to be working with some really smart, talented, and awesome people, and my time is going to likely again be diverted away from this endeavor, at least until I am up to speed. Life is good, so be good!
