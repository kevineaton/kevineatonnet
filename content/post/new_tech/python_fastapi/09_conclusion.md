## Reminder

This is a documentation of my attempt to learn Python with FastAPI to build a simple API. I prefer to learn new tech by doing. This is akin to journaling and is not intended to be used in a production environment. It is a learning experiment. For more information see:

- [Project Overview and Reasoning]({{< ref "/post/new_tech/project_overview.md" >}} "Project Overview and Reasoning")
- [Previous Post]({{< ref "/post/new_tech/python_fastapi/08_testing.md" >}} "Previous Post")

## Conclusion
